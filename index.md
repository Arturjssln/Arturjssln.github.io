## About Me

I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at the University of Freiburg. I am part of the [Generative Intelligence group]("https://genintel.mpi-inf.mpg.de"), led by [Adam Kortylewski]("https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=tRLUOBIAAAAJ&hl=de").

My research lies at the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Computer Graphics. My main goal is to develop generative vision models that enable to reliably perceive the world. Specifically, I study computer vision from a generative perspective, with the hypothesis that vision systems must develop a causal 3D understanding using an analysis‐by‐synthesis approach. My research has demonstrated that these generative vision models are robust, efficient learners that can simultaneously solve various vision tasks.
