## About Me

I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Freiburg. I am part of the [Generative Vision and Robust Learning group]("https://gvrl.mpi-inf.mpg.de"), lead by [Adam Kortylewski]("https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=tRLUOBIAAAAJ&hl=de")
He assisted the development of the OOD-CV benchmark with a focus on the robustness of state-of-the-art classification and pose estimation methods. His research interests include robust vision, generative models, and scene understanding.
## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** robust vision, image recognition, pose estimation, 3D reconstruction, generative learning
- **Machine Learning:** contrastive learning, incremental learning
